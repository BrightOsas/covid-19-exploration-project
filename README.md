# Covid-19-Data-Exploration-Project

On this project I analyze the effect of covid19 globally, using SQL for data query and powerBI and DAX formulas for visualization.

## SQL data query
Using SQL, I answered some questions such as:

1: total number of cases recorded worldwide,

2: top countries with highest record of covid19, 

3: countries with no record of covid19 and more.


## PowerBI Visualization
I created a view table which was imported to powerBI using power query and DAX formula, created a visualization on the result of covid19 on west African countries.
